# Speed Read (Python)
A text based application made so that users can increase their reading speed. 

## To Use the Application
    1. Choose either one of the pre-installed biblical texts or download some text online using a URL
    2. Start reading!
    

## For Best results
    1. Find a speed that is right at your comfort level
    2. Then increase the speed one notch higher than what is comfortable
    3. Continue reading at that speed till you are completely comfortable and continue for a while
    4. Then increase the speed further

If users do this, over time they will increase their reading speed while maintaining their reading comprehension.
